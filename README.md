# miPie

miPie_implementation.py implements the miPie pipeline described here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38107-z 
This performs microRNA identification using integrated evidence (with both sequence- and expression-based data). The original GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jrgreen7/miPIE/tree/master/miPIE

The script trains the microRNA identification model and evaluates it both on a separate dataset and with 10-fold cross-validation.
